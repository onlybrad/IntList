<h1>hehe xd</h1>

<h2>This is the IntList (Intentional Feeding List) application project:</h2>

<p> This project was originally intended to be a little joke. The purpose was to make a program to track
people in order to intentionally feed or troll when they are on your team in a future game. </p>

<h2> Functionalities </h2>

<ul>
<li> Add kid(s) to your list and give a reason to why they are being added </li>
<li> Check if kids are on the list </li>
<li> Remove (Why would you ever do that?) kids from the list </li>
<li> Show the entire list </li>
